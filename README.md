Overview of the project
Project Title: LED Blinking Program on Arduino

Background: This project demonstrates a basic application of the Arduino platform to control an LED. It introduces beginners to microcontroller programming and circuit design.

Objective: To create a program that blinks an LED at regular intervals using an Arduino Uno.

Details:
The program uses Arduino's pinMode() and digitalWrite() functions.
A delay of 1 second is implemented between on/off states.
Outcome: By the end of this project, users will understand how to set up and program a basic LED blinking circuit in an Arduino simulation.
